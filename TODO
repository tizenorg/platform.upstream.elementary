Bugs:
  toolbar sizing is broken in some cases (WEIGHT(0,0) in horizontal box with
    entry WEIGHT(EXPAND,EXPAND))

Things That Just Need To Be Rewritten (tm):
  toolbar icon api is broken, should take an actual elm_icon. requires new
    elm_toolbar_item_update api as well panel edc

callbacks add/del
  panes

api:
  elm_win_type_get()

improvement:
  add a smart move object and autodetect group of moving object in genlist.
  reduce memory used by all this callback we setup around.
  integrate with EO and Clouseau.
